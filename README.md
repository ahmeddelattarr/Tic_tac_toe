# Tic_tac_toe
This is a tic tac toe game that can be played between two players. The game board is a 3x3 grid and each player takes turns marking a square with their symbol. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins.

To play the game, clone the repository and open the tic_tac.py file in a text editor. Then, run the file by typing `python tic_tac.py` in the terminal.

The game will start by asking each player to choose their symbol. The player who chooses `X` will go first.

Once the players have chosen their symbols, the game will begin. The first player will choose a square on the board to mark with their symbol. The second player will then choose a square to mark with their symbol. The game continues in this way until one player wins or the board is full.

If a player gets three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, they win the game. If the board is full and no player has three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, the game is a draw.

To play again, simply close the terminal window and run the file again.
